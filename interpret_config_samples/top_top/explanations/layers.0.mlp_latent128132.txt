"The highlighted tokens are primarily function words (such as articles, conjunctions, prepositions, and auxiliary verbs) and common noun phrases that serve as grammatical connectors or structural elements in sentences. These tokens often mark the boundaries of clauses, introduce or connect ideas, and help define relationships between entities, actions, or descriptions within the text. Their importance lies in structuring the sentence and maintaining coherence, rather than conveying specific content."
