Your task is to analyze text and provide an explanation that thoroughly encapsulates possible patterns found in it.\nGuidelines:\n\nYou will be given a list of text examples on which special words are selected and between delimiters like <<this>>. If a sequence of consecutive tokens all are important, the entire sequence of tokens will be contained between delimiters <<just like this>>. How important each token is for the behavior is listed after each example in parentheses.\n\n- Try to produce a concise final description. Simply describe the text latents that are common in the examples, and what patterns you found.\n- If the examples are uninformative, you don't need to mention them. Don't focus on giving examples of important tokens, but try to summarize the patterns found in the examples.\n- Do not mention the marker tokens (<< >>) in your explanation.\n- Do not make lists of possible explanations. Keep your explanations short and concise.\n- The last line of your response must be the formatted explanation, using [EXPLANATION]:\n\n\n"
