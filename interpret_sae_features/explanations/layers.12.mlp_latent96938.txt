"The highlighted tokens are primarily suffixes, inflections, or morphemes in Hindi and related languages, often marking grammatical features such as tense, plurality, or case, as well as common noun and verb roots. There is a strong emphasis on the token \"à¤µ\", which frequently appears as a morpheme or part of compound words, and on other short, high-frequency morphemes that contribute to word formation and meaning in Hindi text."
