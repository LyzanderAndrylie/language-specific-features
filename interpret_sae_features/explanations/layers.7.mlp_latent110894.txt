"The highlighted tokens are predominantly morphemes, word stems, suffixes, and function words in Russian (and some other Slavic languages), often marking grammatical features such as case, number, tense, aspect, or forming participles and adjectives. There is a strong focus on inflectional and derivational morphology, as well as on common connectors and particles that structure sentences."
