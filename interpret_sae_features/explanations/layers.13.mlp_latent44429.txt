"The highlighted segments are primarily Japanese noun and verb phrases, often including particles and auxiliary verbs, that form meaningful units within sentences. These segments frequently encapsulate actions, states, or descriptive attributes, and often include grammatical constructions that connect or modify other elements in the sentence. The pattern reflects the agglutinative and phrase-based structure of Japanese, where meaning is built up through the combination of content words and function words."
