"The most salient pattern is the frequent activation of common Hindi grammatical morphemes and postpositions, especially those involving the \"क\" (ka/ke/ki) forms, which function as possessive markers, connectors, or case markers, as well as other inflectional endings like \"ों\", \"ी\", \"ा\", and \"े\". These tokens are essential for syntactic structure and meaning in Hindi sentences, often linking nouns, indicating possession, plurality, or case, and forming compound expressions."
