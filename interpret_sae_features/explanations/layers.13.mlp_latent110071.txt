"The highlighted spans are predominantly noun phrases, verb phrases, or collocations that convey key actions, attributes, or relationships within a sentence. These often include subjects, objects, or descriptive elements central to the meaning, such as people, places, activities, emotions, or qualities. The selections frequently capture the core semantic content or the main event of the sentence, often involving personal pronouns, verbs of being or action, and their direct complements or modifiers."
