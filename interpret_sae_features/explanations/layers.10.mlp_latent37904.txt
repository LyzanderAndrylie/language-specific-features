"The highlighted tokens predominantly mark common Bulgarian morphemes, especially suffixes and inflections that form plurals, adjectives, comparatives, and verb conjugations, as well as frequent roots and prefixes. There is a strong focus on the morphological structure of words, particularly endings like -ич, -ен, -ат, -ия, -на, and -ко, which are essential for grammatical agreement and meaning in Bulgarian."
