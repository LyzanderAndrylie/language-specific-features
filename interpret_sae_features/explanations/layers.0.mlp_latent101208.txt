"The most salient pattern is the high activation of Hindi vowel diacritics and suffixes such as \"ा\", \"े\", \"ि\", \"ो\", and \"ी\", which are frequently attached to nouns, verbs, and adjectives to indicate case, possession, gender, number, or tense. These morphemes are essential for grammatical structure and meaning in Hindi sentences."
