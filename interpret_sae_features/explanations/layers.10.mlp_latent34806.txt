"The highlighted tokens are primarily function words, affixes, or short morphemes that serve as grammatical connectors, markers of tense, aspect, or case, and components of compound or derived words. They often appear at the boundaries of phrases or as part of multi-token expressions, reflecting their role in structuring sentences and conveying relationships between ideas in Thai text."
