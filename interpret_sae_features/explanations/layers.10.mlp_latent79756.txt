"The highlighted tokens are primarily function words, affixes, or morphemes in Thai and English that serve grammatical or semantic roles, such as marking causality, negation, comparison, or payment. In Thai, these include frequent use of particles, conjunctions, and affixes that indicate relationships, actions, or states, while in English, the focus is on key content words like \"payment.\" The pattern reflects the importance of structural and connective elements in conveying meaning and relationships within and between clauses."
