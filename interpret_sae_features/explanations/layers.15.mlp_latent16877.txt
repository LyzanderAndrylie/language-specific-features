"The highlighted tokens are primarily Hindi morphemes, suffixes, and inflections, as well as common connective words and noun/adjective endings. There is frequent emphasis on grammatical markers, case endings, and conjunct forms, along with some corrupted or non-standard characters. The pattern reflects a focus on the morphological structure and syntactic connectors in Hindi text, especially those that signal relationships between words or modify meaning."
