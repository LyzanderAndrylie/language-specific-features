"The highlighted spans are predominantly German multi-word expressions, noun or verb phrases, and compound words, often marking grammatical constructs, inflections, or idiomatic units. Many are functionally important for sentence structure, such as verb-final clauses, participial forms, or noun compounds, and frequently include suffixes or prefixes that signal tense, plurality, or case. These patterns reflect the morphological richness and syntactic dependencies characteristic of German text."
