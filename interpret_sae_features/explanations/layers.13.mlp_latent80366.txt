"The highlighted tokens are primarily nouns, noun phrases, and key verbal expressions that denote actions, states, or important entities within sentences. These tokens often represent core semantic content such as people, places, actions, events, and conditions, as well as grammatical markers that indicate relationships or necessity (e.g., \"必要\", \"場合\", \"方法\", \"情報\", \"参加\", \"確認\", \"利用\", \"予約\"). The activations also frequently emphasize compound words, set phrases, and collocations that are central to the meaning or structure of the sentence, including those that express requirements, comparisons, or results."
