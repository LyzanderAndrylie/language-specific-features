"The highlighted tokens are predominantly Turkish morphemes, suffixes, and function words that play a key role in grammatical structure, such as denoting possession, plurality, case, tense, or forming compound words and phrases. These tokens often appear at the end of words or as connectors, reflecting the agglutinative nature of Turkish, where meaning and grammatical relationships are built up through the addition of suffixes and short function words."
