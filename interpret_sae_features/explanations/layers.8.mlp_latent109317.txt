"The highlighted tokens are primarily morphemes, word stems, suffixes, and grammatical endings in Russian (and some in English), often marking case, number, tense, or forming nouns, adjectives, and verbs. There is a focus on functional elements that contribute to word formation, inflection, and syntactic structure, as well as on common connective words and phrase boundaries."
