"The highlighted tokens are predominantly Russian morphemes, word endings, and function words that are essential for grammatical structure, case, and meaning in complex sentences. These include suffixes, inflections, conjunctions, and prepositions, as well as key content words that signal relationships, actions, or abstract concepts. The pattern reflects a focus on the morphological and syntactic elements that construct meaning and coherence in Russian academic or formal text."
