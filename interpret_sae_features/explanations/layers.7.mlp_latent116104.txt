"The character \"ъ\" in Bulgarian is highly activated, especially when appearing within or at the end of words, often as a root or inflectional vowel. Other activations include common Bulgarian morphemes and suffixes, such as those forming participles, comparatives, or noun/adjective endings. The pattern centers on the morphological and phonological significance of \"ъ\" and related morphemes in Bulgarian word formation."
