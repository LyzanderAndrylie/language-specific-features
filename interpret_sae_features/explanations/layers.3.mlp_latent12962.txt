"The most prominent pattern is the frequent activation of Hindi postpositions and grammatical markers, especially the token corresponding to \"à¤•\" (ka/ke/ki/ko/ka), which functions as a possessive, case marker, or connector in Hindi grammar. These tokens are highly activated in contexts where they attach to or modify nouns, pronouns, or verbs, reflecting their central role in sentence structure and meaning in Hindi text."
