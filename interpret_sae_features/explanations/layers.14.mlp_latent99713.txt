"The text frequently highlights pronouns and conjunctions, especially those forming common Portuguese phrases such as \"que você\" (that you), \"se você\" (if you), and negative constructions like \"não\" (not). There is a strong focus on verbal inflections, adverbs, and connectors that structure conditional, temporal, or explanatory clauses, as well as endings that form adverbs or comparatives. These patterns reflect the importance of grammatical connectors and personal references in constructing meaning and flow in Portuguese sentences."
