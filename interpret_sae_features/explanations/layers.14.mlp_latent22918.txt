"The highlighted tokens are primarily functional morphemes, suffixes, prepositions, conjunctions, and date or time expressions in Portuguese, often marking grammatical relationships, verb conjugations, and temporal references. There is a strong emphasis on endings that indicate tense, plurality, or comparison, as well as on tokens that structure time, quantity, and sequence within sentences."
