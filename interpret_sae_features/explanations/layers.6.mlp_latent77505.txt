"The highlighted tokens are predominantly function words, particles, and grammatical markers in Thai (and some in Hindi), such as those indicating possession, location, comparison, or subordination, as well as common pronouns and auxiliary verbs. These tokens play a crucial role in sentence structure, linking, and meaning, often marking relationships between clauses, objects, and actions. Their high activation suggests their importance in parsing and understanding the syntactic and semantic framework of the sentences."
