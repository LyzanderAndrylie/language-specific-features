"The text contains frequent use of Bulgarian function words and particles such as conjunctions, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs, especially forms of \"да\" (to), \"се\" (oneself), \"не\" (not), and prepositions, which are essential for constructing clauses, expressing modality, and forming complex verb phrases. These tokens are highly activated due to their grammatical importance in sentence structure and meaning."
