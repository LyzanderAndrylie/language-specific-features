"The highlighted tokens are predominantly Thai morphemes, syllables, or short words that frequently serve as functional units in compound words, proper nouns, or technical terms. Many activations correspond to prefixes, suffixes, or core morphemes that contribute to the grammatical structure or meaning of the phrase, such as indicating time, quantity, location, or agency. There is a recurring emphasis on tokens that form part of administrative, temporal, or descriptive expressions, as well as those that are central to the construction of compound nouns and formal terminology."
