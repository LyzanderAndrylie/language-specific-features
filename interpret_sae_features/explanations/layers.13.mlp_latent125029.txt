"The text highlights the use of Bulgarian superlative and comparative constructions, especially the prefix for \"most\" or \"best\" attached to adjectives and adverbs, often joined with a hyphen, as well as common suffixes for forming comparatives and superlatives. There is also frequent activation on noun and verb roots, and on morphemes that modify meaning or degree."
