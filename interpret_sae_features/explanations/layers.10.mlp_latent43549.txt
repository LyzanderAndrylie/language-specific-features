"The highlighted tokens are primarily function words, pronouns, conjunctions, prepositions, and common verb forms in Bulgarian (and some in other languages), as well as frequent morphemes and endings. These elements are essential for sentence structure, grammatical relationships, and meaning, often marking tense, negation, possession, or subordination. The activations focus on the connective tissue of language that enables coherent and contextually appropriate communication."
