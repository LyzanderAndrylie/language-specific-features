"The highlighted tokens are primarily Korean morphemes, words, or short phrases that serve as key semantic units, often marking nouns, noun phrases, or grammatical particles that define objects, locations, roles, or actions within sentences. There is a strong emphasis on tokens that denote specific entities, locations, or concepts, as well as grammatical markers that structure meaning, such as subject or object particles, and elements that form compound nouns or descriptive phrases. The pattern reflects the importance of these units in conveying core information and relationships in Korean text."
