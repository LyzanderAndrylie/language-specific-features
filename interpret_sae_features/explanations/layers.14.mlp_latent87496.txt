"The highlighted tokens are primarily Korean morphemes, words, or short phrases that serve as key semantic units in sentences, often marking grammatical roles, objects, actions, or important nouns. Many activations correspond to noun or verb stems, particles, or endings that are essential for meaning in Korean syntax. Some tokens are also numbers, time expressions, or units, which are important for conveying quantitative or temporal information. Additionally, there are frequent occurrences of corrupted or garbled characters, likely due to encoding issues, which are also marked as important, possibly because they disrupt or alter the expected language pattern."
