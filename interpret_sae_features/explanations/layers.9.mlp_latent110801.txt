"The highlighted tokens are primarily Thai morphemes, syllables, or words that function as key grammatical or semantic units, such as conjunctions, classifiers, pronouns, and time or quantity expressions. There is a recurring emphasis on tokens that form part of compound words, time expressions, or serve as connectors (e.g., \"ขณะท\" for \"while,\" \"ประมา\" for \"approximately,\" \"หร\" for \"or\"), as well as on morphemes that contribute to the structure and meaning of phrases, especially in contexts involving time, comparison, or enumeration."
