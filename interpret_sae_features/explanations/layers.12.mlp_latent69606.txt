"The highlighted tokens are predominantly Turkish verb roots and suffixes, especially those forming various tenses, voices, and moods, as well as participles and nominalizations. There is a strong focus on verb morphology, including derivational and inflectional endings that indicate person, tense, aspect, modality, and negation. These patterns reflect the agglutinative structure of Turkish, where meaning is built up through the sequential addition of suffixes to verb and noun stems."
