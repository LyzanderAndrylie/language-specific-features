"The highlighted tokens are predominantly short function words, suffixes, and inflections common in Bulgarian (and some in other languages), such as pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, verb endings, and noun/adjective suffixes. These elements are essential for grammatical structure, agreement, and meaning in morphologically rich languages, often marking case, number, gender, tense, or syntactic relationships."
