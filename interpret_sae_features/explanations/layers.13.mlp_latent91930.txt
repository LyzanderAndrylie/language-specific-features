"The highlighted tokens are predominantly Russian (with some Bulgarian) morphemes, word endings, and function words that are essential for grammatical structure, word formation, and meaning in context. These include case endings, verb conjugations, participles, prepositions, conjunctions, and suffixes that indicate tense, number, gender, or aspect. The activations focus on elements that define syntactic roles, connect phrases, or modify the meaning of nouns and verbs, reflecting the importance of morphology and function words in Slavic languages for sentence construction and semantic clarity."
