"The highlighted tokens are primarily Thai consonants, vowels, and syllables, often appearing at the beginning or within words, and are frequently found in grammatical markers, word stems, or affixes. These tokens tend to have high activation when they form meaningful morphemes, serve as connectors, or are part of common word constructions in Thai text. Occasionally, non-Thai tokens are highlighted when they appear as significant morphemes or name components in other languages."
