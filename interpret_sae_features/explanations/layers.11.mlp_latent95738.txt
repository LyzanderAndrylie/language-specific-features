"The highlighted tokens are primarily function words, prefixes, and morphemes that serve as grammatical connectors or structural markers in Thai sentences, such as indicators of time, condition, possession, or subordination. These tokens often appear at the beginning or within compound words and phrases, and are essential for sentence cohesion and meaning, frequently marking relationships between clauses, actions, or participants."
