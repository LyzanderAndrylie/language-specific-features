"The highlighted tokens are primarily Korean grammatical particles, verb endings, and noun suffixes, as well as some content words and punctuation. These tokens often serve as key syntactic or morphological markers in Korean, indicating case, tense, subject, object, or other grammatical relationships, and are essential for sentence structure and meaning. Some non-Korean examples show similar emphasis on function words, endings, or connectors in other languages."
