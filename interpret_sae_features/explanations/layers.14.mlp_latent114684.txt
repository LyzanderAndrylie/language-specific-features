"The highlighted tokens are predominantly Portuguese suffixes and word endings that indicate verb conjugations, noun and adjective forms, and grammatical inflections, such as tense, number, gender, and person. These include common verb endings (-ar, -ado, -ando, -am, -ou, -ia, -iu, -ava, -ando, -endo, -indo), noun/adjective endings (-ção, -dade, -idade, -mento, -s, -es, -os, -as, -is, -ais, -eira, -eiro), and other morphological markers that are essential for syntactic and semantic structure in the language."
