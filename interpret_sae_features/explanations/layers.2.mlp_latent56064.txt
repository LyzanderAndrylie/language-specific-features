"The highlighted tokens are primarily German morphemes, word stems, or inflections, often marking noun or verb endings, compound word parts, or grammatical function words. Many are common in German-language text, including noun endings (-en, -heit, -keit, -ung), verb forms (-iert, -te, -en), and connecting words (und, von, in, der, die, das, eine). There is also frequent activation on recurring roots in compound nouns and on inflectional suffixes, reflecting the morphological structure of German."
