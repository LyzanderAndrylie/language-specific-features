"The nasalized vowel suffix \"ें\" is highly activated, typically marking the oblique plural or locative case in Hindi nouns, and frequently appears at the end of words to indicate grammatical relationships such as location or plurality. Other nasalized or feminine suffixes like \"ीं\", \"ैं\", and \"ी\" also show activation, reflecting their role in inflectional morphology."
