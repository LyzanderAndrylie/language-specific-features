"The highlighted tokens predominantly mark verb forms, especially those indicating actions or states (such as \"करते\", \"कहते\", \"देखते\", etc.), as well as grammatical particles and suffixes that contribute to tense, aspect, or case. There is also emphasis on noun forms, pronouns, and connectors that structure sentences, reflecting a focus on the core syntactic and semantic elements that drive meaning and grammatical relationships in Hindi text."
