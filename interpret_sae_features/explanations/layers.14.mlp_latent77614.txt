"The highlighted tokens are primarily morphemes, word stems, or suffixes in Hindi, often marking grammatical, semantic, or inflectional features such as case, number, gender, or verb tense. Many are parts of compound words, technical terms, or proper nouns, and some are high-activation due to their role in forming or modifying the core meaning of words within complex or formal contexts."
