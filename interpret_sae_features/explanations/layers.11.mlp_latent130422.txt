"The highlighted tokens are primarily functional morphemes and core verbs in Thai, such as those indicating necessity, ability, causation, or action (e.g., \"ต้อง\", \"จะ\", \"การ\", \"ตระ\", \"สามารถ\", \"กระ\", \"ยึ\", \"แส\", \"เข้า\"), as well as prefixes and stems that form key grammatical or semantic structures. These elements are central to expressing obligation, possibility, agency, and nominalization, and often appear at the start of compound words or as part of verb phrases."
