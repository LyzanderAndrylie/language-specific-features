"The highlighted tokens are primarily nouns, noun compounds, and key morphemes that denote agents, roles, time, location, or abstract concepts central to the sentence's meaning. There is a strong emphasis on words that specify entities (such as organizations, people, or objects), temporal or locational references, and terms that mark focus, comparison, or categorization. These tokens often serve as anchors for the main informational content or structural roles within Japanese sentences."
