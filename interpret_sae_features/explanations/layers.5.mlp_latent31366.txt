"The highlighted tokens are primarily German (and some Russian) morphemes, word stems, and inflectional endings, often marking grammatical features such as case, number, tense, or forming compound nouns and verbs. Many are parts of longer words or compounds, reflecting the agglutinative and inflectional nature of German, and are often found at the beginning, middle, or end of words."
