"The highlighted tokens are predominantly Turkish morphemes, suffixes, and word stems that play key grammatical or semantic roles, such as indicating tense, plurality, possession, or forming compound words. These tokens often appear at the ends of words or as part of agglutinative constructions, reflecting the morphological structure of Turkish, where meaning and grammatical function are built up through the addition of suffixes and inflections."
