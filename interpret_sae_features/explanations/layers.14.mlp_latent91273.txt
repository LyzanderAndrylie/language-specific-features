"The highlighted tokens are predominantly Turkish morphemes, roots, and suffixes that form or modify nouns, adjectives, and verbs, often marking possession, plurality, tense, or case. These segments frequently appear at the end or within words, reflecting Turkish's agglutinative structure where meaning is built up through the addition of affixes."
