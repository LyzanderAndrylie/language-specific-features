"The highlighted tokens are primarily function words, particles, and morphemes that serve grammatical roles in Thai, such as marking tense, aspect, conjunctions, pronouns, and case. There is a strong emphasis on connectors, sentence structure markers, and suffixes that modify meaning or indicate relationships between clauses and entities. These tokens are essential for the syntactic and semantic cohesion of Thai sentences."
