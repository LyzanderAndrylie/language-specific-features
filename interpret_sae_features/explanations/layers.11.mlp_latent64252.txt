"The highlighted tokens are primarily Korean morphemes, words, or word endings that are semantically or grammatically significant, such as verbs, nouns, adjectives, and particles that convey core meaning, tense, or case. There is a strong focus on tokens that mark actions, states, or attributes, as well as those that indicate relationships or structure within sentences. High activations often correspond to key content words or inflectional endings that are essential for understanding the main information or function of the sentence."
