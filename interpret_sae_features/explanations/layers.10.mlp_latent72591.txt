"The highlighted tokens are predominantly Thai morphemes, syllables, or short words that serve as key semantic units within compound words, proper nouns, or technical terms. These tokens often appear at the beginning or within multi-syllabic constructions, marking important grammatical, nominal, or conceptual boundaries in the text. Their selection reflects the agglutinative and compounding nature of Thai, where meaning is built from smaller, meaningful units."
