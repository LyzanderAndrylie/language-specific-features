"The highlighted tokens are predominantly morphemes, roots, prefixes, and suffixes within Bulgarian (and some other Slavic) words, as well as some in other languages, that contribute to the grammatical structure and meaning of verbs, nouns, and adjectives. These include verb stems, inflectional endings, and function words that are essential for forming questions, commands, and statements, as well as expressing tense, aspect, and modality. The pattern reflects a focus on the internal structure of words and the functional elements that drive sentence construction and meaning in morphologically rich languages."
