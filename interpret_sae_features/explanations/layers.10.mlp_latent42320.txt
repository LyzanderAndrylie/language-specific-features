"The highlighted tokens are primarily Thai morphemes, syllables, or short words that serve as key semantic or grammatical units within sentences. Many are high-frequency function words, affixes, or roots (such as those denoting comparison, agency, or time), and often appear at the start or end of compound words or phrases. These tokens are crucial for sentence structure, meaning, and cohesion in Thai text."
