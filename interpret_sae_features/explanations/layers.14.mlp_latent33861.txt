"The highlighted tokens are primarily Thai morphemes, syllables, or short words that serve as grammatical markers, connectors, or key semantic units within sentences. These include function words, affixes, and core content words that are essential for sentence structure and meaning, such as those indicating possession, agency, location, comparison, or action. The pattern reflects the importance of these units in Thai syntax and information flow, often marking relationships between clauses, specifying entities, or denoting actions and attributes."
