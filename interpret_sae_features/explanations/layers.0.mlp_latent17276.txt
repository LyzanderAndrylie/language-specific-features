"The most prominent pattern is the frequent activation of the Hindi character \"ह\" in verb forms, especially as part of auxiliary verbs indicating tense, aspect, or existence (such as है, हैं, होता, होती, होना, हो, etc.), which are essential for sentence structure in Hindi. Other activated characters like \"र\", \"ल\", \"द\", \"भ\", and \"श\" appear less frequently and are typically part of nouns or adjectives, but \"ह\" consistently marks grammatical constructions related to being, happening, or possession."
