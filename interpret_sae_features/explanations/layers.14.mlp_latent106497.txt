"The highlighted tokens predominantly correspond to Turkish noun and adjective roots, suffixes, and compound structures, often marking key semantic units such as institutions, official terms, services, locations, and formal processes. There is a strong emphasis on morphological components (roots and suffixes) that form the core meaning of words, especially in administrative, legal, travel, and service-related contexts. These patterns reflect the agglutinative nature of Turkish, where meaning is built up through the combination of roots and multiple suffixes."
