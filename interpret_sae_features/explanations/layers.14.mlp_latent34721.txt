"The highlighted tokens are overwhelmingly function words, pronouns, and common morphemes or syllables that serve as grammatical connectors in Thai, such as markers for possession, location, time, or subject/object reference. There is a strong emphasis on high-frequency, short tokens that are essential for sentence structure and meaning, including prefixes, suffixes, and particles that modify or clarify the main content words. These tokens are crucial for the cohesion and flow of Thai sentences."
