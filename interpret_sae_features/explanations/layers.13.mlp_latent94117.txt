"The highlighted tokens are primarily Turkish morphemes, compound nouns, and suffixes that form key semantic units such as professions, institutions, services, actions, and descriptors. These tokens often appear at the end of words or as part of compound structures, marking grammatical roles (e.g., possession, plurality, case), or denoting specific domains (e.g., programs, organizations, locations, official documents). The pattern reflects the agglutinative nature of Turkish, where meaning is built up through the addition of suffixes and compound elements."
