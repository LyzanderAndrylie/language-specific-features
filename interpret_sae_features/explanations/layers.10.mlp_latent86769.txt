"The highlighted tokens are predominantly nouns, noun phrases, and key modifiers that denote concrete objects, abstract concepts, time spans, roles, and relationships. Many are compound or multi-character words central to the sentenceâ€™s meaning, often marking scientific, technical, or descriptive content. There is a strong emphasis on terms that specify entities, durations, properties, and causal or functional relationships, reflecting a focus on information-rich, content-bearing elements in Chinese text."
