"The highlighted tokens are predominantly Turkish morphemes, suffixes, and noun or verb stems, often marking grammatical features such as possession, plurality, tense, or case. Many are parts of compound words, inflections, or derivational endings, and frequently appear at the end of words or as part of agglutinative constructions, reflecting the morphological richness and structure of Turkish."
