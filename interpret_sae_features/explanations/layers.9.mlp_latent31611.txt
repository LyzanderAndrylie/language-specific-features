"The highlighted tokens are primarily Korean morphemes and words that serve as grammatical markers, verb endings, or key content words (such as nouns and verbs) essential for sentence structure and meaning. There is a strong emphasis on verb and adjective endings that indicate tense, aspect, or politeness, as well as on nouns and particles that define relationships and actions within the sentence. Additionally, some tokens are corrupted or incomplete, likely due to encoding issues, but the overall pattern centers on the linguistic building blocks that are critical for understanding and generating Korean sentences."
