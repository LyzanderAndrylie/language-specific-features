"The highlighted tokens are primarily Hindi verb suffixes, auxiliary verbs, and noun/adjective endings that indicate tense, aspect, number, gender, or degree. These include common verb endings (such as those for present, past, and future tense), comparative and superlative markers, and participial forms, as well as auxiliary verbs that support the main verb. The pattern reflects the morphological structure of Hindi, where such suffixes and auxiliaries are crucial for grammatical meaning."
