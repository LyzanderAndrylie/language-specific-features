"The highlighted tokens are predominantly Italian word stems, prefixes, and suffixes, often marking verb conjugations, noun/adjective derivations, or common morphemes. These segments frequently appear at the start or within words, reflecting the agglutinative and inflectional nature of Italian morphology. The activations focus on linguistically meaningful subword units that contribute to word formation and grammatical function."
