"The highlighted tokens predominantly mark common Portuguese function words, verb forms, and suffixes that construct conditional, temporal, and causal clauses, as well as personal references (especially to \"vocÃª\" and \"que\"). There is a strong focus on grammatical connectors, pronouns, and verb endings that are essential for sentence structure and meaning, particularly in instructions, explanations, and descriptions."
