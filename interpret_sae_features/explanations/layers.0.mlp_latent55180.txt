"The most important tokens are Hindi postpositions, case markers, and grammatical particles such as \"क\", \"के\", \"की\", \"का\", and related conjuncts, which are essential for indicating possession, relation, or grammatical structure in Hindi sentences. These tokens frequently appear at the boundaries of noun phrases or as connectors, reflecting their central role in sentence construction and meaning."
