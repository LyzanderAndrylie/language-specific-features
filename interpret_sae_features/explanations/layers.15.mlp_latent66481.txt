"The highlighted tokens are primarily Thai morphemes, syllables, or short words that serve as key semantic or grammatical units within sentences. These tokens often mark the beginnings or important parts of compound words, function words, or content words, and are frequently found at the start of phrases, within compound constructions, or as part of inflectional or derivational morphology. The pattern reflects the segmentation of Thai text into meaningful subword units that are crucial for understanding sentence structure and meaning."
