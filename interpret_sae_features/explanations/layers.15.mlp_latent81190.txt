"The highlighted tokens are primarily Thai syllables, morphemes, or short word fragments, often at the beginning or end of words, including prefixes, suffixes, and root components. These tokens frequently appear in proper nouns, compound words, and key content words, reflecting the agglutinative and syllabic structure of Thai, where meaning is built from combining such elements. The activations suggest importance for semantic, grammatical, or named-entity recognition within the language."
