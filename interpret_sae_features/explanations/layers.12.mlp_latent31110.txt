"The highlighted tokens are predominantly Russian morphemes, roots, or affixes that form the core semantic or grammatical structure of words, often marking verbs, adjectives, or nouns. These segments frequently appear at the beginning or end of words and are essential for conveying meaning, tense, aspect, or other grammatical features in Russian. The activations focus on these meaningful subword units that are central to word formation and comprehension in the language."
