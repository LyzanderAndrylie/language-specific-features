"The highlighted tokens are primarily function words, pronouns, particles, and common morphemes in Thai, often marking grammatical relationships, sentence structure, or serving as connectors. There is a strong emphasis on words that indicate possession, agency, time, location, and conjunctions, as well as frequent use of polite particles and verb auxiliaries. These tokens are essential for the syntactic and semantic coherence of Thai sentences."
