"The highlighted tokens are primarily Thai morphemes, syllables, or short words that function as key semantic units, including prefixes, classifiers, pronouns, and common noun or verb roots. These tokens often appear at the start or within compound words, and are frequently used in forming grammatical structures, proper nouns, or technical terms. The pattern reflects the agglutinative and compounding nature of Thai, where meaning is built from short, high-frequency morphemes."
