"The highlighted tokens are primarily Thai morphemes, syllables, or short words that function as grammatical markers, noun or verb roots, or affixes. They often appear at the boundaries of phrases or as key components in compound words, and are frequently associated with high-importance content such as actions, conditions, or objects within sentences. The pattern reflects a focus on semantically or syntactically significant units in Thai text."
