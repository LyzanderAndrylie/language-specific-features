"The English examples highlight the use of the word \"distance\" and its plural \"distances\" in contexts related to measurement, travel, or physical space. The Hindi examples show frequent activation of single-character tokens, especially \"स\" and \"क\", which are common morphemes or syllables in Hindi, often appearing as grammatical markers, prefixes, or within compound words, indicating a focus on morphological or syntactic elements in the language."
