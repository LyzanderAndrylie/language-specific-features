"The highlighted tokens are predominantly Bulgarian morphemes, word stems, and suffixes that form the core of nouns, verbs, and adjectives, as well as grammatical markers for tense, person, and case. These include common inflectional endings, prefixes, and roots that are essential for word formation and meaning in Bulgarian, often marking possession, plurality, aspect, or derivation. The activations focus on linguistically significant subword units that contribute to the syntactic and semantic structure of the language."
