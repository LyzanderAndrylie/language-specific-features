"The most prominent pattern is the frequent highlighting of Japanese grammatical particles such as \"を\", \"に\", \"が\", \"で\", and \"の\", which function as case markers or connectors in sentences. These tokens are essential for indicating grammatical relationships, object marking, and topic or subject identification, and are consistently activated at high importance, reflecting their central role in Japanese sentence structure."
