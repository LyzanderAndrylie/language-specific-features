"The highlighted tokens are primarily Korean nouns, verbs, and grammatical endings that denote key entities, actions, or states within sentences, often marking subjects, objects, or important predicates. Many tokens are part of compound words or phrases that convey core semantic content, such as people, places, actions, or results. There is a strong emphasis on tokens that contribute to the main informational structure of the sentence, including those that indicate possession, causality, or completion."
