"The important tokens are primarily Hindi morphemes, suffixes, and inflections that mark grammatical relationships, case, number, tense, and honorifics, as well as common function words and noun/adjective endings. These tokens often appear at the end of words or as standalone grammatical markers, reflecting the agglutinative and inflectional nature of Hindi syntax."
