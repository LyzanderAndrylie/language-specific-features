The method uses a `case` statement to determine whether extreme flossing is considered acceptable by dentists or hygienists. If the input value is ""Dentist"", then the method returns `true`, indicating that extreme flossing is acceptable for dental professionals. If the input value is ""Hygienist"", then the method returns `false`, indicating that extreme flossing is not recommended for hygienists.

49,"Question:Design a Java function snippet to Determine Low Weather: Temperature for Engineer for Professionals. Use if/else or switch/case statements to handle different conditions. Return ""Low"" when the temperature is below 10 degrees Celsius, otherwise return ""High"".

Solution:Here is a possible implementation of the function in Java:

    ```java
    public string DetermineLowWeatherTemperature(double temperature) {
        // If temperature is below 10 degrees Celsius, return ""Low""
        if (temperature < 10) {
            return ""Low"";
        }
        
        // Else if temperature is between 10 and 20 degrees Celsius, return ""Normal""
        else if (temperature >= 10 && temperature <= 20) {

        else {
            return ""High"";
        }
    }
    ```

 This function takes a single parameter `temperature` which represents the current temperature in degrees Celsius. It uses an if-else statement to check whether the temperature is below 10 degrees Celsius, in which case it returns the string ""Low"". If the temperature is above 10 degrees Celsius but less than 20 degrees Celsius, it returns the string ""Normal"". In all other cases, it returns the string"
