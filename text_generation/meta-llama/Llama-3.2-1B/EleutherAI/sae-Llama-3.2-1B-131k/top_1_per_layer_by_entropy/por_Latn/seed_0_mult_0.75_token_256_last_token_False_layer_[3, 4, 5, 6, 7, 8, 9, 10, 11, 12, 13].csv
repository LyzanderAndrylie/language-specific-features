24,"Question:Write a C# program to count the number of items in a set that are greater than 5. In other words, count all items that are greater than 5 and less than 10. You may assume that the set is not empty. In addition, you may assume that all the items are ordered by a natural order.

Solution:Using a for loop, you can count the items in the set that are greater than 5 and less than 10. Let us first define a function that counts the items in the set that are greater than 5 and less than 10:

```javascript
function countItems(lessThanTen, greaterThanFive) {
    var result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        if (lessThanTen) {
            result++;
        }
        else {
            result = result + 1;
        }
        if (result > 10) {
            break;
        }
        if (result > 5) {
            result = result + 1;
        }
        if (result > 10) {
            break;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

Here, the function takes two parameters: `lessThanTen`"
