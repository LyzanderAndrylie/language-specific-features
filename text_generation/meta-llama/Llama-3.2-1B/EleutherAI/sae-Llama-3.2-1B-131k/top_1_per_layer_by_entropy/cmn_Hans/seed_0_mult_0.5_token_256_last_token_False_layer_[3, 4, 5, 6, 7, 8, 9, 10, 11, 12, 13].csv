14,"Question:Design a C# function snippet to CalculateHighFloss:CheckingHighFloss forDecisionMaking for Experts. Implement if/else or switch/case statements to handle different conditions. Provide detailed comments explaining your solution.

Solution:Here is a possible implementation of this function in C#:

    ```c#
    public static bool CheckHighFloss(double floss) 
    {
        //if statement
        if (floss > 0.95) 
        {
            return true;
        }

        //switch case statement
        switch (true) 
        {
            case floss >= 0.85 && floss <= 0.95:

            default: 
                return true;
        }
    }
    ```
    
    This function uses an if statement to check whether the input floss value is greater than 0.95. If so, it returns true, indicating that the floss is considered high floss. Otherwise, it uses a switch case statement to evaluate the floss value within a range. The ranges correspond to the different levels of high floss, starting from 0.85 and ending at 0.95. If the floss value falls within one of these ranges, then the function returns false"

The floss count is calculated as the sum of the floss count of all patients, where each patient has a unique id. The high floss count is the highest floss count of any patient. The module should use the count() method to count the number of patients with high floss count.
