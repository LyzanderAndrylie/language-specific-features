27,"Question:Develop a Python program that checks whether the number is prime or not. Print ""This number is prime"" if the number is prime, otherwise print ""This number is not prime"".

Solution:We can use the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is prime. The modulo operator (%) is used to check if a number is divisible by 2. To check if a number is prime, we need to divide it by 2 until we get 0. If we reach 0, then the number is not prime. If the number is prime, we print ""This number is prime"".

Code:
```
def is_prime(n):
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

print(""Is 17 prime? "" + is_prime(17))
print(""Is 28 prime? "" + is_prime(28))
print(""Is 97 prime? "" + is_prime(97))
