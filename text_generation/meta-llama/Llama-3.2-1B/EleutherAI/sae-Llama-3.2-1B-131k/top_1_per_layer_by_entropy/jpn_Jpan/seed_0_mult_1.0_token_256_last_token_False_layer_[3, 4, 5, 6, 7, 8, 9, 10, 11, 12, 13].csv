## Answer

The enthalpy of the sample of water before the temperature change is 150 J.

## Explanation

We are given that a 10% change in the temperature of a sample of water causes a 2.0°C change in its enthalpy. Therefore, we have

$\large \frac{2.0°C}{10\%} = \frac{150J}{10J} = 15J$

Therefore, the enthalpy of the sample of water before the temperature change is 150 J.<|end_of_text|>"

Solution:Here is a python function that determines the proper food serving size based on the ingredients provided. The function takes in a list of ingredients and returns a dictionary where each key represents an ingredient and the value is the proper serving size. The proper serving size is determined by checking if the ingredient is present in the ingredients list. If it is, then the appropriate size is taken from the size_list. If it is not present, then the default size is used. Finally, the total number of servings is calculated by multiplying the number of ingredients by the appropriate size.
def determinehighfoods(ingredients, size_list):
    """"""Determine the proper food serving size based on the ingredients.""""""
    for ingredient in ingredients:
        if ingredient in size_list:
            size = size_list[ingredient]
            yield (ingredient, size)
