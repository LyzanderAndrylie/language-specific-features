8,"Question:Develop a Python program for the NthFibonacciNumber. NthFibonacciNumber is a number that is obtained by combining the two previous numbers of a Fibonacci sequence. For example, the first five numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 3, 6, 15, and the first five numbers of the NthFibonacciNumber are 1, 3, 8, 15, 31, and so on. You will need to use the modulo operator to find the remainders of the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. You should also use the floor division operator (/) to get the result of the division. The input for the NthFibonacciNumber is a positive integer representing the number of the next number in the Fibonacci sequence. For example, if the input is 5, the output should be 15. The output should be the number of the next number in the Fibonacci sequence. For example, if the input is 3, the output should be 8.

Solution:Here is a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns a list of numbers that are in the form of n*m*n, where m and n are the numbers of the original list.

Real or Fake News Detection - 500 words
In this project, we are going to develop a Python program for real or fake news detection. We will use the Twitter API to fetch the tweets and then use the pandas library to perform data analysis. The output of the project will be a table that shows the number of tweets that are real or fake.
This project is a part of a larger project in which we are going to collect data from Twitter and then perform data analysis using the pandas library. The overall goal of this project is to show the relationship between the number of tweets that are real or fake and the number of followers of the Twitter account.
Before we can start collecting data from Twitter, we need to obtain the Twitter API keys. The keys are necessary for the Twitter API. They are used to access the Twitter API.
The following is the code that can be used to obtain the Twitter API keys:
#Twitter API keys
consumer_key = 'YOUR_KEY'
consumer_secret = 'YOUR_SECRET'
token = 'YOUR_TOKEN'
token_secret = 'YOUR_SECRET'
