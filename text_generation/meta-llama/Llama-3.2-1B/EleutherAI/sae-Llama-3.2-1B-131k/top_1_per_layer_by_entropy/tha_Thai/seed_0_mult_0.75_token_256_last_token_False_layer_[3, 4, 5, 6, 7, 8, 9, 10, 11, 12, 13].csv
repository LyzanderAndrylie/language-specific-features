    if condition3:
        print(""Condition3 is True"")
    else:
        print(""Condition3 is False"")
```
Answer: It depends on what the condition is. If the condition is to check whether the number is odd or even, then the condition will be true if the number is odd or false if the number is even. If the condition is to check whether the number is a number at all, then the condition will be true if the number is a number and false if the number is not a number.<|end_of_text|>"
