Solution:Here is a sample python code which uses the PyWorm API to transform low weather temperature in the United States in 2023:

    import pyworm
    import requests
    import pandas as pd

    # Get current weather conditions for a random city
    api_key = ""YOUR_API_KEY""  # Replace this with your own API key
    city = pyworm.City(""New York"", api_key)
    weather = city.get_weather()
    
    # Get current temperature in Celsius
    temperature = weather.current_temperature()
    
    # Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit
    temperature_f = temperature * (1.8 + 32)
    
    # Get list of cities in the United States
    cities = pyworm.Cities.list()

The main goal of this program is to check whether the user is following the recommended high eye hygiene while wearing contact lenses. If the user is not following the recommended high eye hygiene, then the program will alert the user about the same and provide instructions on how to do the same. If the user is following the recommended high eye hygiene, then the program will inform the user about the same.
Solution:Here is a sample program in Java that uses the Data API from the OpenAPI API of the World Health Organization (WHO) to check whether the user is following the recommended high eye hygiene while wearing contact lenses. The program takes as input the user’s age, gender, and whether he is wearing contact lenses or not. Based on these inputs, the program checks whether the user is following the recommended high eye hygiene or not. If the user is not following the recommended high eye hygiene, then the program provides instructions on how to do the same. If the user is following the recommended high eye hygiene, then the program informs the user about the same.
