54,"Question:Develop a Python program to check whether a given number is a prime number or not.
Solution:To check whether a given number is a prime number or not, we can use the following algorithm:
1. Start with a given number. (1 is a prime number)
2. If the number is 1, then it is not a prime number
3. If the number is not 1, then divide it by 2 to check if it is a prime number or not
4. If the number is not 1, then it is not a prime number
5. If the number is 2, then it is a prime number
6. If the number is not 2, then it is a prime number
7. If the number is 3, then it is a prime number
8. If the number is not 3, then it is not a prime number
9. If the number is 4, then it is a prime number
10. If the number is not 4, then it is not a prime number
