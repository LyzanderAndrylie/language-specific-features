Incorporate if/else or switch/case statements to handle various cases related to the Trust. Dry-run, ensure your solution is effective and user-friendly. Deploy it to a CDN server to publish the updated low hand washing technique.

Solution:Here's some sample python code which implements the update low hand washing technique ""Rinsing properly"" as requested by the expert:

1. Define a function `update_low_handwashing` to perform the task of updating the low handwashing technique. The function takes two arguments - `technique`, which represents the original low handwashing technique, and `expert`, which represents the name of the expert who provided the instruction. 
2. Use an `if`/`else` statement to check whether the given technique is currently being used by any experts or not. If the technique is currently being used, then do not change it. Otherwise, update the technique by adding a new step at the end of the existing list. For instance, let's say there are two techniques currently being used by experts - Technique A and Technique B. We need to add another step to Technique A so that both techniques look like this:

In this task, the user will be required to input the password of the user account and then check the security level of the account. The program will then print the result to the console.
Solution:Here is a python program which checks the high security level of the user account. The program uses the `os` library to check the security level of the user account and then prints the result to the console.

1. First, we import the `os` library to use its functions.
```python
import os
```
2. Then, we create a function named `check_high_security` which takes two arguments - the username and the password of the user account.
```python
def check_high_security(username, password):
    # Check the security level of the user account
    # If the security level is 1 or 2, print ""High security level""
    # If the security level is 3, print ""Medium security level""
