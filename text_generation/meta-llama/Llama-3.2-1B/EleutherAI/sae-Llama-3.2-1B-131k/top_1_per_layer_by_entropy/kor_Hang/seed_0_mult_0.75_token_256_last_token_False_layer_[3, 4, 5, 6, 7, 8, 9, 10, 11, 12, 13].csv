Solution:Here is one way to do this. First, let's define a variable called 'count' to count how many people floss. Then, we'll use an if statement to check if the count is greater than 100. If it is, we'll print out ""Great job! Keep up the good work."" If the count is less than 100, we'll print out ""Please keep up the good work!"" Finally, we'll use a for loop to print out the message ""Please floss!"" 10 times.<|end_of_text|>"

respectively. The game starts with the life of the whole map occupied by life. The cost of
construction is 13. One life costs 0.5 to create. The cost of transport is 5.
If the death rate is higher than the birth rate, the result is a healthy grassland. If the life
amount in the whole map becomes 80 or greater, the result is a healthy world. If the result is
satisfactory, the result is a perfect world.
Implement the following interface to the Game of Life. Implement the update() method. The
update() method should be called once per the moment to update the whole game. The
initial life should be equal to the minimum life amount shown in the above figure. The
initial life is 100. The life of the whole map becomes 80 or greater to indicate a
satisfactory game. The life of the whole map becomes 80 or greater to indicate a

Solution:Here is a sample java program which displays high handicap scores. The program uses a for loop to iterate through each array and check if the current score is greater than the maximum score. If so, the current score will be stored in the array.

1. Create a new ArrayList called highScoreList. This will store the high scores.
2. For each index in the array, add the current score to the array.
3. If the current score is greater than the maximum score, then add it to the array.
