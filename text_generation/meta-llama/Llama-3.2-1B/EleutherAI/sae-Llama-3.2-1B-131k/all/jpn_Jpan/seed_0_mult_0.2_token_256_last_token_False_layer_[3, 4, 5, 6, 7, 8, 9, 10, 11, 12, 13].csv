Use if/else or switch/case statements to conditionally perform different actions based on the Responsibility. Dry-run, then include comments that outline the control flow and how you handle different scenarios.

Solution:Here is a python script which determines extreme social media content recommendation for analysis by experts. The script uses `if` / `elif` conditional statement to check whether the responsibility of the user who posted the message falls under ""Content Moderation"", ""Analysis"" or ""Expert Review"". If the responsibility belongs to any of these categories, the appropriate action will be taken. In case no match found, default action will be executed. 

```python

Stenosis, stenosis, or stenosis (from Ancient Greek: στενός, stenos, ""narrow"" and osis, ""opening"") is the narrowing of a tube, duct, or other passageway, such as an artery, blood vessel, or a hollow organ. Stenosis may be caused by a congenital defect, trauma, or disease, and is often the result of the accumulation of scar tissue or calcium deposits. Stenosis may be asymptomatic or cause symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or fatigue. Treatment options include medical management, endovascular procedures, and surgical procedures. Stenosis may be a component of a larger process called vascular remodeling, which is characterized by a progressive narrowing of blood vessels, resulting in loss of blood supply to a part of the body.
