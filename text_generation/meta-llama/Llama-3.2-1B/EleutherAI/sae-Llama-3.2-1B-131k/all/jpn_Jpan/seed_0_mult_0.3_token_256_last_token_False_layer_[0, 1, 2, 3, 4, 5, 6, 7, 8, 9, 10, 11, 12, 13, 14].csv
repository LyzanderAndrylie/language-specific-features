Otherwise, the IsPrime(int) method should return false. The IsPrime(int) method should use the Sieve ofEratosthenes to check if the integer is prime.
Solution:Here is a sample implementation of the C# class to check if an integer is prime:

Solution:Here is a python function which determines the low frequency emails based on the number of times they appear in a dataset. The function uses if else statement to check whether the email frequency is greater than 10 or not. If yes,then it returns the email as low frequency else it returns the email as high frequency.
