Use if/else or switch/case statements to conditionally perform different actions based on the Responsibility. Dry-run, then include comments that outline the control flow and how you handle different scenarios.

Solution:Here is a python script which determines extreme social media content recommendation for analysis by experts. The script uses `if` / `elif` conditional statement to check whether the responsibility of the user is ""content creator"" or not. If yes, then it will retrieve all the posts from their timeline and analyze them; otherwise, it will prompt them to enter their own post and analyze it accordingly. Additionally, there is also a dry run mode where the script simulates running without actually posting anything but still outputs what would happen depending on the inputted values.
