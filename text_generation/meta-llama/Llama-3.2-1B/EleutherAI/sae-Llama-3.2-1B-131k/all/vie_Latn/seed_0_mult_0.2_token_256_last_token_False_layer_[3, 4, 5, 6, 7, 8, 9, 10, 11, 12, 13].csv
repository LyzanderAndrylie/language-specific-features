Solution:Here’s a python program snippet to transform extreme hygiene during coughing and sneezing etiquette for decision making for beginners incorporating if else or switch case statement to handle different scenarios related to safety :

Consider the Privacy and implement appropriate if/else or switch/case statements to handle different conditions. Dry-run, then provide comments explaining your decision-making process and how the control flow is structured.

Solution:Here is some sample julia code which implements update low fitness algorithm as described by the prompt:
```julia
function update_low_fitness(individual::Individual)
    # Check if current individual has lowest fitness so far
    if individual.fitness < min_fitness
        # If yes, update minimum fitness and best individual
        min_fitness = individual.fitness
        best = individual
    end

    return best
end
```
In this function we first check if the current individual has lower fitness than our current minimum fitness value `min_fitness`. If it does, we update both the minimum fitness and best individual. We return the best individual at the end of the function.

To dry run this code we can create an instance of `Individual` class and pass it into the function like so:
```julia
individual = Individual(0, [1, 2, 3], 4)
best = update_low_fitness(individual)
println(""Best Individual"

Solution:Here is a possible implementation of this requirement in Golang:

1. Import necessary packages:
```go
import (
    ""fmt""
)
```

2. Define a function to check high security identity verification for engineers:
```go
func VerifyIdentity(trust float64) string {
    var result string

    // Check trust level and return appropriate message
    if trust >= 0 && trust <= 25 {
        result = ""Low risk - No further checks required.""
    } else if trust > 25 && trust <= 74 {
        result = ""Medium risk - Additional authentication may be needed.""
    } else if trust > 74 {
        result = ""High risk - Strong verification procedures must be followed.""
    }

    return result
}
```

3. Call the function and print the output:
```go
fmt.Println(""Identity verification status:"")
identityStatus := VerifyIdentity(80)
fmt.Println(identityStatus)
```
This will output:
```text
Identity verification status:

1. Define constants for input parameters such as age, height, weight etc. 
2. Prompt user to enter their age, height and weight. Use `Scanner` class to get input from user. 
3. Calculate BMI (body mass index) based on entered values. 
4. Use if-else statement to check whether the calculated BMI falls within normal range (18.5 - 24.9). If yes, continue to next step; otherwise, prompt user to re-enter their information until valid input is provided. 
5. Use another if-else statement to check whether the person is male or female. For male, set the target shoe size as 43; for female, set the target shoe size as 39.
