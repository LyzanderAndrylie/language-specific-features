- Define the concept of a vector.
- Apply the concepts of vectors to solve problems.
- Apply the concepts of vectors to solve problems.

## Vectors and Vectors Vectors

Vectors are defined as vectors with a magnitude and a direction. The vector is the combination of the magnitude and direction. The magnitude of the vector is the distance from the origin to the end of the vector. The direction of the vector is the direction of the vector.

Let’s consider a vector $$A = 2\vec{v}_1 + 3\vec{v}_2$$, where $$\vec{v}_1 = 2\hat{a}_1 + 3\hat{b}_1$$ and $$\vec{v}_2 = 2\hat{a}_2 + 3\hat{b}_2$$. The vector $$A$$ has a magnitude of 5 and the direction of the vector is shown in the figure below.

The vector can be expressed as follows:

The magnitude of the vector is 5.

The direction of the vector is $$\hat{a}_1 + \hat{a}_2$$. The vector can be written"
