5,"Question:Develop a TypeScript program snippet to Update Low Hygiene during COVID 19: Cleaning and Disinfecting for Decision Making for Beginners. Use if/else, switch/case, and for loops to solve the problem. The code should be both concise and effective.

Solution:Here is a possible implementation of this task in typescript:

1. Define an enum called `HygieneLevel` which has three values: `Low`, `Medium` and `High`. 
2. Create a function named `updateHygieneLevel` which takes two parameters: `currentHygieneLevel` (the current hygiene level) and `newHygieneLevel` (the new hygiene level). This function will update the hygiene level based on the given input.
3. The function can be written as follows:
```typescript
function updateHygieneLevel(currentHygieneLevel: string, newHygieneLevel: string): void {
    switch (newHygieneLevel) {
        case ""Low"":
            if (currentHygieneLevel == ""Medium"" || currentHygieneLevel == ""High"") {

25,"Question:Build a Ruby module snippet that Checks Low Foot care: Wearing Comfortable Shoes for Decision Making for Experts. Incorporate if/else or switch/case statements to handle different cases related to the Ethics. Ensure your control flow is both concise and clear.

Solution:Here’s a possible implementation of the requested functionality in Ruby:

1. The `check_low_foot_care` function takes two arguments: `shoe_size` (a string representing the size of the person’s feet) and `foot_condition` (an integer value between 0 and 10 indicating the severity of their foot condition). The function returns a string containing a recommendation for the person to wear comfortable shoes based on their input values.

2. To determine whether the given shoe size is suitable for the person’s feet, we can use a combination of the `if`/`then` statement and the `min()` function. This will return the minimum value from the array of allowed sizes if the input size is not found in the list. For instance, if the user enters '9', the function will check if the input value is less than or equal to the size '8', '7'... '6', '5', '4', '3', '2', '1'"

a) The method should take an integer array of size 5, each element of which represents the number of times the bathroom has been used by each person.
b) The method should return an integer, the number of times the bathroom has been used by more than 3 people.
c) The method should return 0 if the bathroom has not been used by more than 3 people.
d) The method should return 1 if the bathroom has been used by exactly 3 people.
e) The method should return -1 if the input array is not a valid array of size 5.
Solution:Here is a possible implementation of the method suggested:
```java
    public static int calculateLowHygiene(int[] times) {
        int lowHygiene = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

    In this exercise, you will practice using nested loops and indexing to manipulate a 2D array.
