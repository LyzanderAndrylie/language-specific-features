Solution:Here is a possible implementation of this task in typescript:

1. First we define our input variables as constants at the top of the file:
```typescript
const examName = ""Extreme Education"";
const grade1 = 90;
const grade2 = 85;
const grade3 = 73;
const trustLevel = ""Beginner"";
```

2. Then we can create a function which takes three inputs (examName, grade1, grade2) and returns updated results based on the given criteria:
```typescript
function updateResults(examName: string, grade1: number, grade2: number): { examName: string; grade1: number; grade2: number; } {
  let result;

  // Check if trust level is beginner
  if (trustLevel === ""Beginner"") {

Solution:Here is some sample julia code which implements update low fitness algorithm as described by the prompt:

In this function we first check if the current individual has lower fitness than our current minimum fitness value `min_fitness`. If it does, we update both the minimum fitness and best individual. We return the best individual at the end of the function.

To dry run this code we can replace the input `Individual` object with some dummy values like so:
```julia
individual = Individual(0, 0)
update_low_fitness(individual)
```
And check the output:

3. Initialize model and fit training data:
```python 
regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()
regr.fit(X, target)

98,"Question:Develop a Java program snippet to Check Low Foot care: Wearing Comfortable Shoes for Engineer for Experts. Incorporate if/else or switch/case statements to handle various cases related to the Privacy. Dry-run, ensure your control flow logic is clear and well-commented.

Solution:Here is a possible implementation of this requirement in java:

1. Define constants for input parameters such as minimum height requirement, maximum weight limit etc. 
```java
private static final int MIN_HEIGHT = 5ft; // Minimum height for wearing comfortable shoes
private static final double MAX_WEIGHT = 120kg; // Maximum weight allowed for wearing comfortable shoes
```

2. Create a method to calculate the BMI of a person based on their height and weight. This method can take into account both male and female genders. The formula used here is BMI = weight / height^2. We will use this value later to determine whether the person needs to consult a doctor about their feet.
```java
private double calcBmi(int height, double weight){
    return weight / Math.pow(height, 2);
}
```

3. Create another method to check whether the person meets the minimum height requirement or not. If they don't, then return false immediately. Otherwise, continue"

    Write a function that takes in a list of patient information and returns a list of patients who have a history of depression and have not received any treatment for it.

    The function should use a for loop to iterate through the list of patient information and check if each patient has a history of depression. If a patient has a history of depression, the function should add them to a new list. If a patient has not received any treatment for depression, the function should not add them to the new list.

    The function should return the new list of patients who have a history of depression and have not received any treatment for it.

    For example, if the input list is:
    [
        {""name"": ""Alice"", ""age"": 32, ""gender"": ""F"", ""depression_history"": True},
        {""name"": ""Bob"", ""age"": 45, ""gender"": ""M"", ""depression_history"": False},
