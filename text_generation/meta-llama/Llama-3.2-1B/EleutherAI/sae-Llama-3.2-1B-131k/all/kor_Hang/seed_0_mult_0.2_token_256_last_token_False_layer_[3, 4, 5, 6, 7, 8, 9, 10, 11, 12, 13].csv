Incorporate if/else or switch/case statements to handle different cases based on the Safety. Ensure your control flow is well-documented with comments explaining your approach.

Solution:Here is a possible implementation of this requirement in java:

1. Import necessary libraries:
```java

2. Define a class called ""CheckExtremeSocialMedia"" which takes in two arguments - safety (an integer value between 0 and 5) and a list of social media platforms (a list of strings). The function will check whether each platform has extreme levels of safety or not depending upon its index in the given list. If any platform has a higher score than 4 then all other platforms will also be considered as having 'extreme' safety level. 

3. Write the main method where we can call the function and pass appropriate arguments:
```java 
public class CheckExtremeSocialMedia {

Consider the Safety and implement appropriate if/else or switch/case statements to handle different conditions. Dry-run, then provide comments explaining your decision-making process and how the control flow is structured.

Solution:Here is some sample julia code which implements update low fitness function as described : 

```julia 
function update_low_fitness(individual::Individual)
    # Get current best solution 
    best = deepcopy(individual)
    
    # Loop through all individuals in population
    for i in 1:length(individuals)

        fitness = calc_fitness(individuals[i])

            best = deepcopy(individuals[i])

 In this implementation we first define a `update_low_fitness` function that takes an individual as input and returns the updated best solution.
