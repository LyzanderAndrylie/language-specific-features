Consider the Safety and implement appropriate if/else or switch/case statements to handle different conditions. Dry-run, then provide comments explaining your decision-making process and how the control flow is structured.

Solution:Here is some sample python code which calculates low haircare styling tips based on analysis of experts' opinions. The program uses if/else statements to check for certain conditions and handles them appropriately. The program also includes a dry run to test the logic of the program and explain the decision making process. 

```python
