Incorporate if/else or switch/case statements to handle various cases related to the Safety. Dry-run, ensure your control flow logic is clear, and provide appropriate comments explaining your approach.

Solution:Here is python code which determines extreme footcare based upon user input of their daily activities. It incorporates use of `if` and `elif` conditional statements as well as a simple `switch` statement to determine what action to take depending on the users responses. The program also includes basic error handling to prevent crashes when invalid inputs are provided.

Incorporate if/else or switch/case statements to handle different cases based on the Trust. Ensure your control flow is well-documented with comments explaining your approach.

Solution:Here's a possible implementation of sucha module in Ruby:
```ruby
module CheckHighSocialMedia
  def self.check(trust)
    case trust
      when 0..49
        ""Very Low""

      when 75..90
        ""Medium""
      else
        ""High""
    end
  end
end
```
This method takes one argument - `trust`, which represents the level of social media trustworthiness. It uses a series of `if` statements to determine the corresponding social media marketing strategy based on the value of `trust`. The levels of trust are defined as follows:
* Very Low (0-49): Should use a low-key strategy focused on building relationships and establishing credibility.
* Low (50-74): Should focus on building relationships and establishing credibility while also leveraging some form of paid advertising.
* Medium (75-90): Should focus on building relationships and establishing credibility,"

Incorporate if/else or switch/case statements to handle different cases based on the Responsibility. Ensure your control flow is well-documented with comments explaining your approach.

Solution:Here is a possible implementation of this functionality written in Typescript:
```typescript

  updatedMessage = responsibility === ""Engineer""? 
    `Avoiding contamination during construction` :

```
In this example, we define a function called ```updateExtremeToiletHygiene()```that takes one argument - ```responsibility```. The function uses a ternary operator to determine which message to display based on the value of ```responsibility```. If ```responsibility```equals `""Engineer""`,then the message will be ""Avoiding contamination during construction"", otherwiseit will be ""Regular cleaning and disinfecting"". Finally,the function returns the updatedmessage.<|end_of_text|>"

The function uses an if...elif...else statement to evaluate each condition sequentially until one returns True, at which point the corresponding action will be taken. A default case handles all other conditions. Note that this is just one possible implementation; there may be other ways to solve this problem depending on specific requirements and constraints.
