Incorporate if/else or switch/case statements to handle different cases based on the Safety. Ensure your control flow is well-documented with comments explaining your approach.

Solution:Here's a possible implementation of sucha module in Ruby:
```ruby
module CheckExtremeSocialMedia

    else
      puts(""This platform has high levels of safety."")
      return nil

In this implementation, we define a `check` method which takes one argument - `safety`. The method uses a `case` statement to evaluate the value of `safety`, and returns `true` if the platform has low levels of safety, `false`if the platform has medium levels of safety, and `nil`if the platform has high levels of safety.<|end_of_text|>"
