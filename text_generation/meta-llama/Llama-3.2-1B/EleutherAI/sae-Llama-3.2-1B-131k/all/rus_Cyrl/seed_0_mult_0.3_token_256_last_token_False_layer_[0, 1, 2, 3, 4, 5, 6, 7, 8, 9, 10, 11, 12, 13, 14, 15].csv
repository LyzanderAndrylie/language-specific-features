98,"Question:Develop a Python program snippet to Check Low Toilet hygiene: Keeping Toilet Area Clean for Engineer for Professionals. Incorporate if/else and switch/case statements to handle various cases related to the Trust. Dry-run, ensure your control flow and readability.

Solution:Here is python code which implements dry run of checking low toilet hygiene by incorporating if else statement : 

```python 
# Define function to check toilet area cleanliness
def check_toilet():
    # Initialize variables
    bacteria = 0
    fecal_antibody = 0

    # Prompt user to enter sample result
    print(""Enter test result:"")
    bacteria = float(input(""Enter bacteria count:""))
    fecal_antibody = float(input(""Enter fecal antibody titer:""))
    
    # Perform calculations based on entered values
    if bacteria > 1000:
        print(""Toilet has high bacterial count"")
