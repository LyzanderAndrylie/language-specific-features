47,"# A 2D model for the distribution of soil moisture in the Earth's crust

### Abstract

The soil moisture distribution in the Earth’s crust is studied in the frame of the 2D model. The 2D model is based on the soil moisture content, x, and the soil moisture gradient, �x, and it is developed in two stages. The first stage is the construction of the initial data for the 2D model, and the second stage is the solution of the 2D model for the time-dependent boundary conditions. The initial data for the 2D model are calculated by the method of subdomain decomposition. The subdomain decomposition of the soil moisture is done in two steps. First, the soil moisture is divided into two subdomains: the subdomain 1 and the subdomain 2. The soil moisture in the subdomain 1 is divided into two subdomains, subdomain 1a and subdomain 1b, and the soil moisture in the subdomain 2 is divided into two subdomains, subdomain 2a and subdomain 2b. The soil moisture in the subdomain 1a is then divided into two subdomains, subdomain 1a1 and subdomain 1a2"
