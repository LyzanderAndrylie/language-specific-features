Incorporate if/else or switch/case statements to handle various cases related to the Ethics. Dry-run, ensure your control flow logic is clear, and add comments to explain your approach.

Solution:Here is a python program which implements high security checks based upon ethical considerations as per the title of this question. The main function takes two arguments - `input_data` and `output_path`. It first reads the input file (`input_data`) line by line into a list of strings. Then, for each line, it performs the following steps:

1. Checks whether the line contains any sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, social security numbers etc. If so, it replaces them with asterisks (`*`) to protect the privacy of the user. This is done using the `re` module from the standard library.
2. Checks whether the line mentions any potential security risks like phishing, malware, ransomware etc. If so, it adds a warning message at the beginning of the line. This is done using the `warnings` module from the standard library.
3. Checks whether the line mentions any potential legal issues like copyright infringement, trademark violation, defamation etc. If"

Use if/else or switch/case statements to conditionally perform different actions based on the Trust. Dry-run, then include comments that outline the control flow and how you handle different scenarios.

Solution:Here is a python script which determines extreme hygiene in shared space by maintaining personal hygiene in those areas where there is high risk of contamination such as bathrooms, kitchens etc.. The program uses `if` statement to check whether the trust level is low (0), medium(1) or high(2). Based on this value, appropriate action will be taken. 

```python

Incorporate if/else or switch/case statements to handle different cases based on the Safety. Ensure your control flow is well-documented with comments explaining your approach.

Solution:Here's some sample java code which implements a function to check extreme social media usage by professionals:

    public class ExtremeSocialMedia {
    
        // Define possible levels of safety
        enum SafetyLevel {

In this code we define an enum called `SafetyLevel` which represents three possible levels of safety - low, medium, and high. The `isExtreme()` method takes a `SafetyLevel` parameter and uses a switch statement to determine whether social media usage is considered extreme based on the specified safety level.
