Solution:Here is a python program which implements high security checks based upon ethical considerations as per the title of this question. The main function takes two arguments - `input_data` and `output_path`. It first reads the input file (`input_data`) line by line into a list of strings. Then, for each line, it performs the following steps:

1. Checks whether the line contains any sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, etc. If so, it prints out a warning message and returns False immediately. 
2. Otherwise, it continues to the next step.
3. Reads the current line into a variable called `line`.
4. Checks whether the current line contains any keywords indicating potential security risks. If so, it prints out a warning message and returns False immediately.
5. Otherwise, it continues to the next step.
6. If all lines have been processed without any warnings being raised, the function returns True indicating that the input file does not contain any potentially dangerous"

Use if/else or switch/case statements to conditionally perform different actions based on the Trust. Dry-run, then include comments that outline the control flow and how you handle different scenarios.

Solution:Here is a python script which determines extreme hygiene in shared space by maintaining personal hygiene in those areas where there is high risk of contamination such as bathrooms, kitchens etc.. The program uses `if` / `elif` conditional statements to determine appropriate action depending upon the level of trust between individuals involved. A dry run has been included at the beginning of the script to show possible outcomes before including detailed explanations of each step. 

```python
