## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• describe the origin of the periodic table
• identify the chemical elements and their properties
• describe the classification of elements
• describe the location of the elements on the periodic table
• predict the properties of a compound based on the properties of its elements

The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements. The elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, or the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom. This is the number that determines the element’s identity. The number of electrons determines the element’s identity, but the number of protons determines the element’s identity. The periodic table is a universal tool that allows chemists to predict the properties of elements and their compounds based on their properties and the properties of the elements they combine. In the next section, we will describe the origin of the periodic table and how it is used to classify the elements.

Incorporate if/else or switch/case statements to handle various cases related to the Consent. Dry-run, ensure your control flow logic is clear, and add documentation (including comments) to explain your approach.

Solution:Here is a python program which implements decision making based upon hand washing at public places such as restaurants etc... The program uses `if` statements to check whether consent has been given by the user before cleaning their hands. If no consent was given, then the user will receive an error message. Additionally, there is also a default case where the user can choose between two options (yes / no). This allows us to implement a simple yes / no question during runtime. 

```python 
# Prompt the user for their consent
print(""Do you give your consent to clean your hands?"")
consent = input()

# Check the users consent
if(consent == ""yes""):
    print(""Thank you! Your hands were cleaned."")
