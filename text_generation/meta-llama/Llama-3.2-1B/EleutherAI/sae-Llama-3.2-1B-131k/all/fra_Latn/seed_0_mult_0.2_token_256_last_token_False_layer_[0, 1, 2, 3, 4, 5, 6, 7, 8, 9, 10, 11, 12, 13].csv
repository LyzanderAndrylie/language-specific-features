98,"Question:Develop a Java program snippet to Calculate High Personal Organization: Goal Tracking for Decision Making for Experts. Incorporate if/else or switch/case statements to handle various cases related to the Responsibility. Dry-run, ensure your control flow logic is clear and well-commented.

Solution:Here's some sample java code which implements high personal organization goal tracking for decision making by experts : 

```java 
import java.util.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.println(""Enter your name : "");
        String name = scan.nextLine();

        System.out.println(""Enter your age : "");
        int age = scan.nextInt();

        System.out.println(""Enter your height (in cm) : "");
        double height = scan.nextDouble();

        System.out.println(""Enter your weight (in kg) : "");
        double weight = scan.nextDouble();

        // Calculating BMI
        double bmi = weight / Math.pow(height / 100, 2);

        // Assigning responsibilities based on BMI
        if (bmi < 18.5) {
            System.out.println(""Your BMI is "" + bmi);
            System.out.println(""Your responsibility is : "");
            System.out.println(""\t1"
