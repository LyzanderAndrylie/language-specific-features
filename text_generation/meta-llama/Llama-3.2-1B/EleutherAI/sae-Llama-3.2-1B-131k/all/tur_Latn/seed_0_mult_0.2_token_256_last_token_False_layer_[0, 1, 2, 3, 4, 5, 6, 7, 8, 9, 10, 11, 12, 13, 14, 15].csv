The Gini index is a measure of the dispersion of the distribution. It is calculated by the ratio of the sum of the squares of the deviations from the mean to the total of the deviations from the mean. It is calculated as follows:

Gini = (s2 / n) / (s2 / n + s2 / n-1) = (s2 / n2) / (s2 / n + s2 / n-1) = (s2 / n2) / (s2 / n2 + s2 / (n-1)2) = 1 / (1 + s2 / n2)

Gini index is the ratio of the sum of the squares of the deviations from the mean to the total of the deviations from the mean. It is calculated as follows:
