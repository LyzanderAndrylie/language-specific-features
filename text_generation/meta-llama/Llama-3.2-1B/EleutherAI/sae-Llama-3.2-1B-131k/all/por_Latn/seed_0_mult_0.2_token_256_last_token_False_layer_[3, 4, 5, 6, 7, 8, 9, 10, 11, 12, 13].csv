Consider the Safety and implement appropriate if/else or switch/case statements to handle different conditions. Provide comments explaining your decision-making process and how the control flow is structured.

Solution:Here is some sample python code which displays low weather temperatures based off of analysis by professionals. The code uses an if statement to check whether the current temperature is below freezing point. If so, then the message ""It looks like there will be some snow tomorrow!"" will be displayed. Otherwise, the message ""The weather seems fine today."" will be shown. 

```python 
import datetime
from datetime import date

current_date = date.today()
today = current_date.strftime(""%A, %d %B %Y"")

if current_temperature < 0:
    print(""It looks like there will be some snow tomorrow!"")
elif current_temperature >= 0 and current_temperature <= 10: 
    print(f""{today} seems fine. The weather forecast predicts {current_temperature}°C"")
else:
