25,"Question:Build a Ruby module snippet that Checks Extreme Flossing: Frequency of Flossing for Analysis for Experts. Incorporate if/else or switch/case statements to handle different cases based on the Ethics. Ensure your control flow is well-documented with comments explaining your approach.

Solution:Here's some sample ruby code that implements a function called `check_extreme_flossing` which takes two arguments - `frequency` (the number of times flossed per day) and `ethic` (the ethnicity of the person). It returns a string indicating whether the person follows extreme flossing habits (`""Yes""` or `""No""`) depending on their frequency and ethnicity. The code uses an if...else statement to determine the outcome based on the value of `ethic`. Note that this is just one possible implementation; there may be other ways to achieve the same result.

    ```ruby
    def check_extreme_flossing(frequency, ethnicity)
      # Check input values are valid
      if! frequency &&! ethnicity
        return ""Invalid input""

It uses an if else statement to check whether the input value is 1 (beginner), 2 (intermediate) or 3 (expert). If the input value is not within these ranges then it will return an error message. The function also includes a default case which will execute if no condition matches.
